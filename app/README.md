# APP

Unfortunately ran out of time with doing the client stuff, the most fun part. Regardless, I'll try to get it done in the next couple of weeks as a fun excercise of trying out things I wanted to for a while.
For now, I've added only a few things from a previous project to help to get this started.

### TODOS
  * Build basics
  * Add unit tests
  * Implement http2
  * Add integration tests
  * Add some performance tests
  * Add end-to-end tests (I need more experience on this anyway)
  * Add service worker
  * Try to add the React app into a web worker thread, and make the main one only handle the renders?
